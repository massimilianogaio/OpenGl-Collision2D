# OpenGl-Collision2D
Simple 2D collision system for 2D shapes.
A shape consists of a Transform for position transformations and a RigidBody for calculating physics. Each shape 
The collision is resolved according to Elastic collision, in which the total kinetic energy of the two bodies remains the same.
Each shape is characterized by a random color, direction and size. The mass and acceleration are dependent on its size.
